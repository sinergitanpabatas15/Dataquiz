# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created and finished first item: signup page.

### Day 2: 26 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created second item: checkout page.

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of mobile version and basic function of shopping cart button. Planned to implement processing order animation, this is my first time to do this type of animation, I guess may need more time to plan and create.

### Day 3: 27 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 5: 29 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Do small experient on float label form, had a hard time on the overlap of label and texts.

**Thoughts:** Create my first float label form! Glad that I finished this challenges and know more about patterns and HTML5 validation API for form.

### Day 6: 30 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted form to dispatch events and add some styles. Also, finished my first score meter using svg and div animations.

**Thoughts:** Stucked for the autocomplete function in browser, so the label and autofilled values will be overlapped. Now seems solved by adding change event at initial setup.

Also created my first combinations of svg animation and div!
