### Day 2: 26 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created second item: checkout page.

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of mobile version and basic function of shopping cart button. Planned to implement processing order animation, this is my first time to do this type of animation, I guess may need more time to plan and create.

### Day 3: 27 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 4: 28 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 5: 29 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Do small experient on float label form, had a hard time on the overlap of label and texts.

**Thoughts:** Create my first float label form! Glad that I finished this challenges and know more about patterns and HTML5 validation API for form.

**Link to work:** [Float label form with basic validation](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/EegWVb)

### Day 6: 30 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted form to dispatch events and add some styles. Also, finished my first score meter using svg and div animations.

**Thoughts:** Stucked for the autocomplete function in browser, so the label and autofilled values will be overlapped. Now seems solved by adding change event at initial setup.

Also created my first combinations of svg animation and div!

### Day 8: 3 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using flexbox layout to create table for the first time!

**Thoughts:** Stucked in width and nested row issues for long time, but now fixed. It took long time for me to create mobile and tablet version, hope its design is not so weird.

**Link to work:** [Flex Table Page](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/NLpZjv)

### Day 8: 4 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create css grid and semantic version of table, also create my first article of how to create them!

**Thoughts:** Stucked at nested table css grid version for long, finally find a solution of grid-column-start and grid-column-end. Also, it is hard to create an article of detailed tutorials... Just because of my laziness. It is difficult to explain or write out what is in my mind.

### Day 9: 6 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create my first codepen challenge! This week is status page and I chose 404 page. Finished!

**Thoughts:** The time of animation needs more efforts to tune and adjust between different screen sizes. Also, it is hard to think of the design of this page! When I look at others' designs, I felt my page is not very good :(

### Day 10: 7 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to create HTML audio play and investigating design and details.

### Day 11: 9 Sep 2018

### Day 12: 10 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today is family day, just watched first lesson of Java beginner course in coursera.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to learn java because I want to improve and clarify my OOP concept, I thought strong type language has some advantages over weak typed language like javascript, and much more design patterns are available. Hopefully, I can improve my knowledges on these issues.

### Day 13: 11 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create my first smooth scroll using native method and requestAnimationFrame method.

**Thoughts:** I struggle a lot when try to implement requestAnimationFrame method, but thank for the tutorial online, I guess I know more about it. Also, I hope to write down my knowledge on Medium.

### Day 14: 13 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep watching articles of how to create websites with accessibility.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to create a website with accessibility, if you need to create custom dropdown or select, you will need more efforts to recreate the accessibility part. But designers love custom fancy dropdowns and selects!

### Day 15: 14 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep creating the music player with time viewer and control.

### Day 16: 15 Sep 2018

### Day 20: 19 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to setup React Sever Side Rendering with webpack.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time to do SSR for React and I don't know there are so many steps to do! I leart about renderToString function in React-Dom and know more about webpack public path and content base. However, there is still some error in server side, and I don't know why it occurrs.

### Day 21: 20 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep fighting with webpack config, mainly the public path and output path.

### Day 22: 23 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add back eslint and prettier for this project.

**Thoughts:** It is so fun to build a webpack config, just like playing with puzzles! First, I tried to use Airbnb config, but finally decided to use my own config for learning. It is amazing to see VS Code starts to highlight your syntax mistakes.

### Day 23: 24 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished my react-ssr! Added router and redux for this project!

**Thoughts:** Finally added redux and router, it is a pain to setup routes and redux for SSR. I even don't know why all the tutorials need to create one routes file and decentralized it again. Maybe this is my next mission?

### Day 23: 25 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create mini project: Ladder menu for practicing CSS.

**Thoughts:** I haven't use animation or transition for a long time, I guess this is time for me to pickup it as soon as possible.

### Day 24: 26 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create rounded title in codepen!

**Thoughts:** It is hard to maintain the same shape while word increases or in mobile version. Finally, I limited the word amount and set min-width in mobile version.

**Link to work:** [Rounded Title](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/PyYpNN)

### Day 25 - 27: 1-3 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create personal project for web scraping using php + curl + mysql.

**Thoughts:** It is my first time to use php, curl with mysql. It seems easy to use php to do web scraping on the first sight, but it becomes difficult if I need to get information from 500+ pages. The key is sleep for few random seconds and set cookie and user agents using curl.

### Day 28: 4 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a metric converter using boilerplate of Freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I learnt a lot from this, even it is not finished yet. Learnt about Helmet.js and the implementations of unit test and functional tests.

**Link to work:** [Metric Converter](https://github.com/snowleo208/metric-imp-converter)

### Day 29: 5 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add more unit tests on metric converter.

### Day 30: 6 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add more images in quiz and start development on mobile and desktop version.

**Thoughts:**: It is a pain to search for questions and images for the quizzes, but I finished it! The quiz part still need some adjustments for desktop versions but most of the functions are done. Luckily it is a simple quiz only.

### Day 31-32: 8-9 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create answer transition of quiz page.

**Thoughts:**: The page is not finished yet, as the transition has some weird issues. Still need some time to fix it :(

### Day 33: 10 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create introduction page and result page with new image for quiz. Add fade in effects on logo, text, header ... etc.

### Day 34: 11 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**:Finally put my quiz into codepen!!

**Thoughts:**: Used lots of time to solve the React problems in codepen, especially the react-transition-group issues. However, it is worth it when I see the results!

### Day 34: 11 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fix some minor issues of the result page in codepen, fixed the share link to codepen url.

### Day 35 - 37: 12-14 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to figure out the new magento 2 and how to migrate a old magento 1 site to version 2.2. The structure of magento 1 and 2 is extremely different and I used lots of time to figure out how to use composer and work with magento cli. Finally migrated all attributes and products after 2 days!!

**Thoughts:**: The documentation of migration tools is not very clear, I used lots of time to figure out what's happening. Especially I need to solve all error before migration, otherwise it would cause error and need to revert to clean database.

### Day 38 - 40: 15-17 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a new custom module for overwriting core invoice and shipment pdf of magento 2.2. Change minor things of the pdf e.g. font and remove some fields e.g. tax in invoice and shipment pdf.

**Thoughts:**: It is great when I saw my custom pdf works. I learn more about namespace and override functions in php... lol.

### Day 41 - 43: 18-20 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add back custom contents of original site to new one. For the php web scraper, the cookie using curl finally works, finally knew that I need to put something like `cookie.txt` and `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1)` after the cookie `CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE` settings.

## Day 44: 21 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add new modules to magento: yopto, sendgrid and alsoviewed. Add more customisations to magento front-end, change in stock wordings to custom attribute and add custom translations to current theme.

Besides magento, now tried to create .Net backend and walk through official materials. Hope to create the book store project in freecodecamp using .Net server.

## Day 45 - 47: 24-27 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resume my progress of the night life app for FreeCodeCamp, created overlay for map and images in bar details page.

**Thoughts:**: I learn a lot about the High Order Component(HOC) and passing children using overlay component.

However, I can't figure out how to make HOC work with my current code base with React, React-redux and React-saga. It seems work on home page but failed in bar details page due to reached maximum update limits. Why?
