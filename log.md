### Day 2: 26 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created second item: checkout page.

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of mobile version and basic function of shopping cart button. Planned to implement processing order animation, this is my first time to do this type of animation, I guess may need more time to plan and create.

**Link to work:** [Checkout Page](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/dqGRxx) (Draft only)

### Day 3: 27 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 4: 28 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 5: 29 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Do small experient on float label form, had a hard time on the overlap of label and texts.

**Thoughts:** Create my first float label form! Glad that I finished this challenges and know more about patterns and HTML5 validation API for form.

**Link to work:** [Float label form with basic validation](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/EegWVb)

### Day 6: 30 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted form to dispatch events and add some styles. Also, finished my first score meter using svg and div animations.

**Thoughts:** Stucked for the autocomplete function in browser, so the label and autofilled values will be overlapped. Now seems solved by adding change event at initial setup.

Also created my first combinations of svg animation and div!

**Link to work:** [Basic score meter](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/NLbjOw)

### Day 7: 31 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the checkout page! Stucked in the animation for long time and finally fixed!

### Day 8: 3 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using flexbox layout to create table for the first time!

**Thoughts:** Stucked in width and nested row issues for long time, but now fixed. It took long time for me to create mobile and tablet version, hope its design is not so weird.

**Link to work:** [Flex Table Page](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/NLpZjv)

### Day 8: 4 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create css grid and semantic version of table, also create my first article of how to create them!

**Thoughts:** Stucked at nested table css grid version for long, finally find a solution of grid-column-start and grid-column-end. Also, it is hard to create an article of detailed tutorials... Just because of my laziness. It is difficult to explain or write out what is in my mind.

### Day 9: 6 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create my first codepen challenge! This week is status page and I chose 404 page. Finished!

**Thoughts:** The time of animation needs more efforts to tune and adjust between different screen sizes. Also, it is hard to think of the design of this page! When I look at others' designs, I felt my page is not very good :(

**Link to work:** [404 Page](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/full/ZMXOpB/)

### Day 12: 10 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today is family day, just watched first lesson of Java beginner course in coursera.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to learn java because I want to improve and clarify my OOP concept, I thought strong type language has some advantages over weak typed language like javascript, and much more design patterns are available. Hopefully, I can improve my knowledges on these issues.

### Day 13: 11 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create my first smooth scroll using native method and requestAnimationFrame method.

**Thoughts:** I struggle a lot when try to implement requestAnimationFrame method, but thank for the tutorial online, I guess I know more about it. Also, I hope to write down my knowledge on Medium.

### Day 14: 13 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep watching articles of how to create websites with accessibility.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to create a website with accessibility, if you need to create custom dropdown or select, you will need more efforts to recreate the accessibility part. But designers love custom fancy dropdowns and selects!

**Today's Progress**: Keep creating the music player with time viewer and control.

### Day 16: 15 Sep 2018

**Link to work:** [Music Player](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/zJMqog)

### Day 20: 19 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to setup React Sever Side Rendering with webpack.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time to do SSR for React and I don't know there are so many steps to do! I leart about renderToString function in React-Dom and know more about webpack public path and content base. However, there is still some error in server side, and I don't know why it occurrs.

### Day 21: 20 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep fighting with webpack config, mainly the public path and output path.

### Day 22: 23 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add back eslint and prettier for this project.

**Thoughts:** It is so fun to build a webpack config, just like playing with puzzles! First, I tried to use Airbnb config, but finally decided to use my own config for learning. It is amazing to see VS Code starts to highlight your syntax mistakes.

### Day 23: 24 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished my react-ssr! Added router and redux for this project!

**Thoughts:** Finally added redux and router, it is a pain to setup routes and redux for SSR. I even don't know why all the tutorials need to create one routes file and decentralized it again. Maybe this is my next mission?

**Link to work:** [React SSR Template](https://github.com/snowleo208/react-ssr-template)

### Day 23: 25 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create mini project: Ladder menu for practicing CSS.

**Thoughts:** I haven't use animation or transition for a long time, I guess this is time for me to pickup it as soon as possible.

**Link to work:** [React SSR Template](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/KxJMaE)

### Day 24: 26 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create rounded title in codepen!

**Thoughts:** It is hard to maintain the same shape while word increases or in mobile version. Finally, I limited the word amount and set min-width in mobile version.

**Link to work:** [Rounded Title](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/PyYpNN)

### Day 25 - 27: 1-3 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create personal project for web scraping using php + curl + mysql.

**Thoughts:** It is my first time to use php, curl with mysql. It seems easy to use php to do web scraping on the first sight, but it becomes difficult if I need to get information from 500+ pages. The key is sleep for few random seconds and set cookie and user agents using curl.

### Day 28: 4 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a metric converter using boilerplate of Freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I learnt a lot from this, even it is not finished yet. Learnt about Helmet.js and the implementations of unit test and functional tests.

**Link to work:** [Metric Converter](https://github.com/snowleo208/metric-imp-converter)

### Day 29: 5 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add more unit tests on metric converter.

### Day 30: 6 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add more images in quiz and start development on mobile and desktop version.

**Thoughts:**: It is a pain to search for questions and images for the quizzes, but I finished it! The quiz part still need some adjustments for desktop versions but most of the functions are done. Luckily it is a simple quiz only.

### Day 31-32: 8-9 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create answer transition of quiz page.

**Thoughts:**: The page is not finished yet, as the transition has some weird issues. Still need some time to fix it :(

### Day 33: 10 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create introduction page and result page with new image for quiz. Add fade in effects on logo, text, header ... etc.

### Day 34: 11 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**:Finally put my quiz into codepen!!

**Thoughts:**: Used lots of time to solve the React problems in codepen, especially the react-transition-group issues. However, it is worth it when I see the results!

**Link to work:** [Food Trivia Quiz](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/WajvaJ)

### Day 34: 11 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fix some minor issues of the result page in codepen, fixed the share link to codepen url.

**Link to work:** [Food Trivia Quiz](https://codepen.io/snowleo208/pen/WajvaJ)

### Day 35 - 37: 12-14 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to figure out the new magento 2 and how to migrate a old magento 1 site to version 2.2. The structure of magento 1 and 2 is extremely different and I used lots of time to figure out how to use composer and work with magento cli. Finally migrated all attributes and products after 2 days!!

**Thoughts:**: The documentation of migration tools is not very clear, I used lots of time to figure out what's happening. Especially I need to solve all error before migration, otherwise it would cause error and need to revert to clean database.

### Day 38 - 40: 15-17 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a new custom module for overwriting core invoice and shipment pdf of magento 2.2. Change minor things of the pdf e.g. font and remove some fields e.g. tax in invoice and shipment pdf.

**Thoughts:**: It is great when I saw my custom pdf works. I learn more about namespace and override functions in php... lol.

### Day 41 - 43: 18-20 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add back custom contents of original site to new one. For the php web scraper, the cookie using curl finally works, finally knew that I need to put something like `cookie.txt` and `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1)` after the cookie `CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE` settings.

## Day 44: 21 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add new modules to magento: yopto, sendgrid and alsoviewed. Add more customisations to magento front-end, change in stock wordings to custom attribute and add custom translations to current theme.

Besides magento, now tried to create .Net backend and walk through official materials. Hope to create the book store project in freecodecamp using .Net server.

## Day 45 - 47: 24-26 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resume my progress of the night life app for FreeCodeCamp, created overlay for map and images in bar details page.

**Thoughts:**: I learn a lot about the High Order Component(HOC) and passing children using overlay component.

However, I can't figure out how to make HOC work with my current code base with React, React-redux and React-saga. It seems work on home page but failed in bar details page due to reached maximum update limits. Why?

## Day 48: 30 Oct 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deployed nightlife application to heroku.

**Thoughts:**: Finally got heroku works with PostgresQL! However, seems Google login doesn't work after update, luckily I fixed it in few hours. Still need to add profile page of user and add more functions!

## Day 49-51: 8-10 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created few html mini widgets using dribbble designs.

**Thoughts:**: Used dribbble's ui animations to improve my CSS animation and interaction ui skills. It is hard to master this skill but I finially finished two! Hope to improve more in the future :)

## Day 55-59: 13-18 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to manually migrate orders and create new magento 2 products. Also, create a new script for automatically scrape data and create product csv from specific website.

**Thoughts:**: My first time to use curl and php to scrape and create csv files. It is not very difficult, but needs lots of adjustments for csv files.

## Day 60-61: 19-20 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a new React app for getting currency rates from API. Try to implement different functions, change base currency and add/remove currency lists.

**Thoughts:**: My first time to create a PWA (Progressive Web Apps), hope it will be okay when deploy.

**Link to work:**
[Currency PWA](https://gitlab.com/snowleo208/currency-pwa)

## Day 62-64: 21-23 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add d3 graph into [Currency PWA](https://gitlab.com/snowleo208/currency-pwa)'s React component, just a line graph for showing currency rates.

**Thoughts:**: My first time to use d3 v4 with React, used lots of time to make it work. However, the result seems good. I still need to create a mouseover effect and tooltip for rates.

**Link to work:**
[Currency PWA](https://gitlab.com/snowleo208/currency-pwa)

## Day 65: 26 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Use Lumen (Laravel) to create backend for [Currency PWA](https://gitlab.com/snowleo208/currency-pwa) and added converter, get currency rates and a scheduled job to fetch rates from 3rd party API.

**Thoughts:**: My first time to create API with Lumen, have a difficult time to understand the mechanism of triggering the jobs/queues/scheduled tasks. Finally, I added my first job to fetch API. Hooray!

## Day 66: 27 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Use Lumen and added login/register method with JWT token. Also implemented reset password function with copying methods from Laravel.

**Thoughts:**: Have a hard time to figure out how to use built-in function of Laravel (reset password email) with Lumen. First, I tried the method from StackOverflow, but the reset url in email always duplicated with "http://localhost:4500", and I cannot set to different url. Finally I figure out that, I should create a new notification and sent the token with the new url, and now it is working.

I can set the url to any url I want. Yeah!

[Currency Backend](https://gitlab.com/snowleo208/currency-backend)

## Day 67-69: 28-30 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on D3 and React, try to add currency chart using D3.js, which is my first trial and error.

**Thoughts:**: Haven't use D3 for a long time, needs more time to figure out how it works and how can it work with React.

## Day 70 - 74: 3-6 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read articles on pagespeed and how to get the best loading performance using defer, prefetch and preconnect.

**Thoughts:**: It is difficult to cater with Google Pagespeed, but the score goes higher when some tweaks are implemented. Glad to see the pagespeed score rises from 69 to 87 in mobile and 82 to 96 in desktop!!

## Day 75: 14 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a contact form with instant validation using HTML5 validation with input event listener.

**Thoughts:**: Learn more about input and change event listener of form. It looks really good when I try to use tick and error svg as background image! It looks really professional and clean.

## Day 76: 15 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a post of how I struggled to get higher score in Google PageSpeed last week. Also, read a lot from other developers about loading performance and some insteresting tech like [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck).

## Day 77-78: 22-23 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Start working on my new portfolio with new design. Decided to use React for this project.

**Thoughts:**: Used lots of time to find a great design for my portfolio, finally got one. Try to add as much projects as possible, using React with JSON with react-router.

## Day 79-80: 24-25 Dec 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on my portfolio and added react router dom and new contents.

## Day 81: 1 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles on CSS modules and styled components. Wondered which is better for my projects. :)

**Thoughts:**: Seems CSS modules are more convenient to implement on existing, also it is easier to share styles. For the styled components, all styles are in the components, which seems difficult to share styles between components...

## Day 82: 2 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learn about the gatsby.js, which is a static site framework, contains router, server rendering and other plugins, included simple ecommerce function.

**Thoughts:**: Try to figure out what Gatsby.js does, in my opinion, it just look like a bundle of different tools. And its routing function only existing when I use seperate JS files, how can I do routing like abc/:id? Seems not very practical to use routing like this. Of course, it is fine to use it for static pages.

## Day 83: 5 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on my portfolio page and add fix on my weather app v2. Fixed webpack config and finally used new dependencies without vulnerability issues.

## Day 84: 12 Jan 2019

## Day 85: 13 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue in working on my portfolio page, finally working on Netlify. The most important thing is the path of base directory. I used lots of time to figure out, if I need to put index.html in root with other asset folders, I need to put base directory: '/' in deploy settings in Netlify panel.

**Link to work:**

## Day 86: 15 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Used some time to create portfolio gallery images and put it on my portfolio.

## Day 87: 21 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add contact form validation function and grouped all page components to "Page" folder. Still need some time to add lazy loading function in portfolio.

## Day 88-89: 26 - 27 Jan 2019

**Today's Progress**: Used php to create web crawler, for getting ASIN from Amazon JP page. Set curl to Amazon JP search page with cookie, search project by JAN barcode, then extract all ASINs inside result URL.

## Day 90: 2 Feb 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on my new portfolio site. Today started working on the contact form, adding styles and invalid styles.

## Day 91: 3 Feb 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on the contact form, added PHP script to get form data. Also, post data from client side. Furthermore, changed all path of facico and font to local, for enhancing loading performance.

## Day 92: 6 Feb 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start working on the project page. Compressed and cropped all images. Also, start working on the tablet and mobile styles, especially styles on Chrome (as I developed on Firefox).

Also, used React-helmet to add different page title to different routes.

## Day 93: 7 Feb 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start working on the project details page. Add different size of image gallery, one for details page, a bigger one for image lightbox. Created new componenet of Overlay to show bigger images.

## Day 94: 11 Feb 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add font weight 500 fonts to portfolio page, as it looks weird on Windows. Also, started my first project with Angluar + Node.js + Typescript + Graphql, decided to create a clone of Pinterest.

**Thoughts:**: This is my first time to use Typescript with Express.js, used lots of time to solve error. Also, graphql server improved a lot since my last touch of it. Last time I used express-graphql with MySQL to create Pinterest clone, but stucked with context, relay style pagination and auth side, so that project was abandoned.

This time, I tried to use apollo-server with Mongodb and that is quite simple compared to express-graphql with sequelize + MySQL. Hope I can finish it! :)
