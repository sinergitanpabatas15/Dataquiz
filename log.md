### Day 2: 26 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created second item: checkout page.

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of mobile version and basic function of shopping cart button. Planned to implement processing order animation, this is my first time to do this type of animation, I guess may need more time to plan and create.

### Day 3: 27 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 4: 28 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add: transition animation draft of checkout component and desktop version of whole page

**Thoughts:** Finished draft of animation. Little bit stucked at the smooth animation, don't know why it won't work after close popup, hope I can figure it out later. Also, added desktop version of this page, will change the layout later.

### Day 5: 29 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Do small experient on float label form, had a hard time on the overlap of label and texts.

**Thoughts:** Create my first float label form! Glad that I finished this challenges and know more about patterns and HTML5 validation API for form.

### Day 6: 30 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted form to dispatch events and add some styles. Also, finished my first score meter using svg and div animations.

**Thoughts:** Stucked for the autocomplete function in browser, so the label and autofilled values will be overlapped. Now seems solved by adding change event at initial setup.

Also created my first combinations of svg animation and div!

### Day 8: 3 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using flexbox layout to create table for the first time! 

**Thoughts:** Stucked in width and nested row issues for long time, but now fixed. It took long time for me to create mobile and tablet version, hope its design is not so weird.

### Day 8: 4 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create css grid and semantic version of table, also create my first article of how to create them!

**Thoughts:** Stucked at nested table css grid version for long, finally find a solution of grid-column-start and grid-column-end. Also, it is hard to create an article of detailed tutorials... Just because of my laziness. It is difficult to explain or write out what is in my mind.

### Day 9: 6 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create my first codepen challenge! This week is status page and I chose 404 page. Finished!

**Thoughts:** The time of animation needs more efforts to tune and adjust between different screen sizes. Also, it is hard to think of the design of this page! When I look at others' designs, I felt my page is not very good :(

### Day 10: 7 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Try to create HTML audio play and investigating design and details.

### Day 11: 9 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create audio play with basic play functions and interface. Try to add forward and backward function later.


### Day 12: 10 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today is family day, just watched first lesson of Java beginner course in coursera.

**Thoughts:** I am trying to learn java because I want to improve and clarify my OOP concept, I thought strong type language has some advantages over weak typed language like javascript, and much more design patterns are available. Hopefully, I can improve my knowledges on these issues.

### Day 13: 11 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create my first smooth scroll using native method and requestAnimationFrame method.

**Thoughts:** I struggle a lot when try to implement requestAnimationFrame method, but thank for the tutorial online, I guess I know more about it. Also, I hope to write down my knowledge on Medium.

### Day 14: 13 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep watching articles of how to create websites with accessibility.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to create a website with accessibility, if you need to create custom dropdown or select, you will need more efforts to recreate the accessibility part. But designers love custom fancy dropdowns and selects!

### Day 15: 14 Sep 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep creating the music player with time viewer and control.

### Day 16: 15 Sep 2018
